For example, Eldridge et al. reviewed 152 cluster-randomized trials in primary care of which 41% did not account for clustering in their analyses (Eldridge 2004). Such analyses create a ‘unit of analysis error’ and produce over-precise results (the standard error of the estimated intervention effect is too small) and P values that are too small. They do not lead to biased estimates of effect. However, if they remain uncorrected, they will receive too much weight in a meta-analysis. Approximate methods of correcting trial results that do not allow for clustering are suggested in Section 16.3.6. Some of these can be implemented by review authors.""",-1,-1
3698,QIT-13,Comparability with individually randomized trials,"""In a meta-analysis including both cluster and individually randomized trials, or including cluster-randomized trials with different types of clusters, possible differences between the intervention effects being estimated need to be considered. For example, in a vaccine trial of infectious diseases, a vaccine applied to all individuals in a community would be expected to be more effective than if the vaccine was applied to only half of the people. Another example is provided by Hahn et al., who discussed a Cochrane review of hip protectors (Hahn 2005). The cluster trials showed large positive effect whereas individually randomized trials did not show any clear benefit. One possibility is that there was a ‘herd effect’ in the cluster-randomized trials (which were often performed in nursing homes, where compliance with using the protectors may have been enhanced). In general, such ‘contamination’ would lead to underestimates of effect. Thus, if an intervention effect is still demonstrated despite contamination in those trials that were not cluster-randomized, a confident conclusion about the presence of an effect can be drawn. However, the size of the effect is likely to be underestimated. Contamination and ‘herd effects’ may be different for different types of cluster.""",-1,-1
